      "I am a violinist rooted in classical tradition and driven by a deep love of musical exploration across cultures and genres. My playing blends classical repertoire, gypsy jazz, traditional fiddle styles, improvisation, and modern experimental music—always with an ear toward connection, groove, and storytelling.",
      "Growing up in Chicago surrounded by jazz, blues, classical, and folk music, I began orchestral training early and studied traditional Irish fiddle at the Academy of Irish Music of Chicago. I studied violin performance at Augustana College, then moved to San Luis Obispo where I helped build Speak Studios and recorded with local bands including Proxima Parada and Moonshiner Collective. I've performed with the Cal Poly Symphony, San Luis Obispo Symphony, and as a fiddler with Moonshiner Collective.",
      "I'm an active collaborator and bandleader, co-founding The Cimo Brothers (violin-guitar duo) and leading The Big Sirs of Swing, a gypsy jazz ensemble. My current studies focus on expanding jazz vocabulary through Grappelli's solos, deepening Irish traditional music, and continuing my lifelong study of Bach.",
      "With over 15 years of teaching experience, I specialize in helping students demystify music theory, technique, and improvisation in a supportive way. As a composer and arranger, I've written for projects like The Robe of Rainbow Colors and arrange modern pop for live performance. I also create immersive events blending violin with electronics and world music. Whether performing solo or with ensembles, my goal is to bring presence, versatility, and musical conversation to every performance."
