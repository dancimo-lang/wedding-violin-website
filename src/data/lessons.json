    "description": "I have been teaching violin and fiddle for over 15 years, working with students of all ages and experience levels. My teaching philosophy centers on making music theory, technique, and improvisation approachable and enjoyable. I help students learn to play within the style they love—whether that's classical, jazz, fiddle, folk, or contemporary music—while building strong fundamentals and musical confidence.\n\nLessons often include custom practice recordings, play-along tracks, and stylistic examples so students can learn by listening and doing. My goal is to give students the tools to understand music, trust their ears, and feel free to express themselves on the instrument."
